# Splitr

:warning: This is a beta version. Use it at your own risk!

Splitr is a free and open-source app that lets you create multiple projects, add and track expenses, split expenses unevenly between members, and settle up balances between group members. It's a great alternative to other expense tracking apps, especially for groups who need to manage expenses together.

## Installation

This is currently a beta version. To get the app, you have to build it yourself with flutter or download the latest beta version [here](https://github.com/BhasherBEL/Splitr/releases).

:warning: Upgrading from version 0.x to 0.y does not guarantee compatibility, and backward compatibility is not assured. Proceed with caution.
